# J-Stack Evidence Ledger

## Overview

Make evidence auditable, cited, scoped, and reusable across stories.

J-Stack treats journalism as a transparent production system: a story moves from editorial mission to evidence, claims, countercase, legal/ethics review, drafting, red-team, ship gate, and post-publication accountability. This skill is one role inside that system, not a magic all-purpose journalist.

Core law:

> No public claim ships above its evidence grade. Strong opinion is allowed; weak factual basis is not.

## US Edition v1.1 — Jurisdiction Overlay

When the publication, audience, platform, source, or subject has a United States nexus, apply `references/us-publication-context.md` before final status. Do not transplant German/EU press-law assumptions into US work. At minimum, identify the relevant state(s), federal forum, publication venue, subject status, public-record posture, and platform context.

Track US-specific risks where relevant: First Amendment/public-concern framing, public official/public figure/private figure status, actual malice/negligence, fact vs opinion, fair-report/public-record privileges, anti-SLAPP and retraction statutes, privacy torts, reporter shield/source protection, recording/access/CFAA issues, copyright/fair use/DMCA, FTC/native-ad disclosures, election/securities sensitivities, and platform rules.

Treat request-for-comment as a US fairness and risk-mitigation practice, not as a single nationwide statutory right of reply. If state law, subpoena/source protection, privacy, defamation, copyright, or platform exposure is material and unresolved, mark `US_LOCAL_COUNSEL_REQUIRED`, `LEGAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, or `NOT_READY` rather than `PUBLICATION_READY`.

## When to Use

- A story needs an evidence appendix or defensibility record.
- Multiple sources support or contradict the same claim.

## Do Not Use For

- Do not store secrets or unnecessary raw personal data.
- Do not make evidence pages public by default.

## Role in the J-Stack Newsroom

- **Skill family:** `facts-claims`
- **Primary responsibility:** Make evidence auditable, cited, scoped, and reusable across stories.
- **Upstream inputs:** mission brief, editorial line, source map, claim ledger, or story hub as applicable.
- **Downstream consumers:** command center, drafting, legal/ethics, red-team, ship gate, distribution, or post-publication tracking.

## Inputs

- Story slug or working title.
- Editorial Mission Brief, if available.
- Existing GBrain story/source/claim pages, if available.
- User-provided notes, documents, links, claims, or draft text.
- Explicit constraints: jurisdiction, language, public voice, publication venue, deadline, and sensitivity.

## Outputs

- Evidence Ledger
- Evidence cards
- Scope notes
- Archive/provenance status

## Workflow

1. Assign stable evidence IDs.
2. Record provenance, retrieval date, source class, excerpt, and limitation.
3. Map evidence to claim IDs.
4. Mark whether evidence directly proves, indirectly supports, contextualizes, or contradicts.
5. Prepare a publishable evidence appendix only after sensitivity review.

## GBrain Integration

### Reads from GBrain

- `source cards`
- `claim ledger`
- `document register`

### Writes or Proposes in GBrain

- evidence/<story>/<evidence-id> pages
- links evidence -> supports/contradicts claim
- timeline entries for source retrieval if relevant

### Tool Pattern

When available, prefer these GBrain tools:

- `mcp_gbrain_get_page` for exact story/source/claim pages.
- `mcp_gbrain_query` for semantic recall of prior investigations and related background.
- `mcp_gbrain_search` for exact names, claim IDs, URLs, legal terms, and source titles.
- `mcp_gbrain_put_page` only for concise, non-secret pages.
- `mcp_gbrain_add_link` for typed edges between stories, claims, sources, evidence, entities, and timelines.
- `mcp_gbrain_add_tag` for retrieval tags such as `jstack`, `claim-ledger`, `source-card`, `legal-risk`, or `ship-gate`.
- `mcp_gbrain_add_timeline_entry` for durable story events, source retrievals, publication decisions, corrections, and rebuttals.

If GBrain is unavailable, write the same artifacts as Markdown under the story workspace and keep a manifest for later import.

## Source and Evidence Rules

- Primary sources beat commentary when both are available.
- Official assertions, judicial findings, leaked documents, interviews, and journalistic reports are different evidence classes.
- A source card must state what the source proves and what it does not prove.
- Allegations, reported claims, official allegations, court findings, analysis, and opinion must be labelled distinctly.
- Translation risk must be noted for non-original-language materials.
- Missing evidence is an output, not a failure to hide.

## Legal and Ethical Boundaries

- This skill provides editorial assistance and risk screening, not final legal advice.
- Do not fabricate citations, quotes, identities, affiliations, or legal conclusions.
- Do not publish unsupported allegations of crime, corruption, espionage, sanctions evasion, money laundering, sexual misconduct, intentional deceit, or hidden control as fact.
- Do not expose private addresses, accounts, family details, health details, or unrelated personal data unless the public-interest and legal/ethics gates justify it.
- Do not send, post, file, contact sources, or externally publish without explicit human approval.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Collecting evidence without saying what it proves.**
2. **Quoting too much raw material.**
3. **Losing archive status or retrieval date.**

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Objective and artifact type are explicit.
- [ ] Evidence grade is not overstated.
- [ ] Facts, interpretation, thesis, and rhetoric are separated.
- [ ] GBrain read/write behavior is clear.
- [ ] Sensitive information is excluded or minimized.
- [ ] Output can be reviewed by a skeptical editor.
- [ ] US context is classified as `US_CONTEXT_NOT_REQUIRED` or reviewed under `references/us-publication-context.md`.
- [ ] No external publication/send/post action is taken without human approval.

## One-Shot Recipe

```text
Use jstack-evidence-ledger on <story/topic>.
Inputs: <mission brief, links, notes, existing GBrain slugs>.
Produce the required artifact, separate facts from interpretation, update/propose GBrain pages and links, and return the next J-Stack step.
